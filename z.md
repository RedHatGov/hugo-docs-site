1. Query GitHub for all repos that follow the "workshop format" with a tag, yaml file, or something that signifies that it is a workshop and ready to be published.

2. Parse array/orject to find all links to those repos

3. Curl/Wget the markdown page for the workshop 

4. Create new markdown/adoc page (hugo new /workshop/$workshopname.adoc)

5. Pre-pend front matter to each new page using (prepend-file.js)
